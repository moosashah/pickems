## Discord bot for worlds pickems?

idea is that an admin will create a poll. users will be able to vote on a team and win points if they're right. At the end you can see the winner with the highest points

intitially it was going to be a golang server but since its a lot of votes within 1-5 mins i was worried about scale/ddosing so make it serverless. also gives me a chance to play with sst
